#  Anomaly Detection in Transactions
Anomaly detection plays a crucial role in safeguarding financial systems, detecting fraud, and ensuring operational integrity. This project implements a machine learning-based approach to identify unusual or suspicious transaction patterns using Python.

## Project Overview
Anomaly detection in transactions refers to identifying unusual or unexpected patterns that deviate from normal behavior. These anomalies might signal fraudulent activities, system glitches, or other irregularities that require investigation.
This project uses the Isolation Forest algorithm, a powerful unsupervised learning method well-suited for high-dimensional data, to detect such anomalies effectively.

### Key Features

- Preprocessing and exploration of transactional data.

- Feature engineering for better model performance.

- Anomaly detection using the Isolation Forest algorithm.

- Visualizations to understand data distribution and model output.

- Hyperparameter tuning for improved accuracy.
  
- Real-time visualization with Streamlit.

- Python : Core programming language

- Pandas, NumPy : Data manipulation

- Matplotlib, Seaborn : Data visualization

- Scikit-learn : Machine learning (Isolation Forest)
